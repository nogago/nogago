        Cell signal or data connection is not required to record GPS tracks. However, if there is no
    data connection, you will only see a Map using the nogago® Map app. In nogago® Tracks, you will see a grey screen or a
    partial map. You can setup in the preferences, that nogago® Maps is always for map display instead of the built-in online map.
    Tracks, represented as simple lines, can still be viewed even if there is no data connection or nogago® Maps is not installed.</string>
