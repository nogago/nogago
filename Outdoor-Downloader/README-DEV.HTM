<h2><a name="CodeAccess">Code access</a></h2>
<p>If you want do get your hands on the latest source code of Mobile
Atlas Creator you can check out the code from the Subversion repository
at SourceForge:</p>
<p><a
	href="https://mobac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mobac/trunk/MOBAC"><tt>https://mobac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mobac/trunk/MOBAC</tt></a>
</p>
<p>There you will find the latest sources of Mobile Atlas Creator in
form of an Eclipse (v3.6) project. All tools, libraries, sources and
build files are included in this repository.</p>

<h2><a name="EclipseCompile">Compiling MOBAC within Eclipse</a></h2>
<p>If you want to run MOBAC from within Eclipse you only need
Eclipse with Java Development Tools installed (included in all Eclipse
Java editions). <br />
The root class for starting MOBAC in Eclipse <tt>mobac.StartMOBAC</tt></p>
<p>Compile/building Mobile Atlas Creator without Eclipse requires <a
	href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>) which is used for
building the jar version of Mobile Atlas Creator and of course the Java
Development Kit (JDK) installed.</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingMOBAC">Building Mobile Atlas Creator</a></h2>
<p>For building Mobile Atlas Creator please run Apache Ant on the
provided file <tt><a href="build.xml">build.xml</a></tt></p>
<p>The default build target performs all necessary tasks for
compiling the sources, packaging the classes to the main jar and the map
packs and then minimizing the size of the jar using <a
	href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/">ProGuard</a> (<tt>lib/proguard.jar</tt>).<br>
Additionally the build steps include a call to <tt>lib/svnversion.jar</tt>
which is a Java only version of the command <a
	href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/re57.html">svnversion</a>
(bases on <a href="http://svnkit.com">SVNKit</a>). This command updates
the SVN revision information in file <tt>src/main/java/mobac/mobac-rev.properties</tt>
which is included in the final jar of Mobile Atlas Creator.</p>

<h2><a name="GuidelinesCustomReleases">Guidelines for
publishing custom builds/releases</a></h2>
<p>If you modify Mobile Atlas Creator and you want to publish it
yourself please consider the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Chose a version/release name that makes it clear that it is
	not an official release: Change the version string to reflect that.<br>
	Example: <tt>1.9 beta 3 XYZ edition</tt><br>
	The version string is located in the properties file <tt>src/main/java/mobac/mobac.properties</tt>.
	Change the entry <b>mobac.version</b> to your custom release name.</li>
	<li>Do not forget that Mobile Atlas Creator is a GPL project -
	therefore publishing the source code together with the binary release
	should went without saying.</li>
	<li>If your modification is useful you may consider to present it
	to the Mobile Atlas Creator development team. <a
		href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238075&atid=1105496">Patches</a>
	are always welcome. Useful modifications have a great chance to be
	integrated into the main branch.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="MapPacks">Map sources and map packs</a></h2>
<p>Since version v1.9 map sources are no longer part of <tt>Mobile_Atlas_Creator.jar</tt>.
All map sources implementation are located in jar files in the <tt>mapsources</tt>
sub-directory. Those map sources implementation packages are called
"map-packs". Map packs files always starts with the term <tt>mp-</tt>
and they end with the term <tt>.jar</tt>.</p>
<p>For implementing new map sources in a development environment
like Eclipse it is sometimes faster to load the map sources directly
from class-path rather from the map-packs. You can enable it by setting
<tt>devmode</tt> in <tt>settings.xml</tt> to <tt>true</tt>. Afterwards
map sources will be loaded directly from the <tt>bin</tt> directory of
Eclipse (if available).</p>
<h2><a name="CustomMapPack">Developing a custom map pack</a></h2>
<p>For creating your own custom map pack you have to create a new
Java package below <tt>mobac.mapsources.mappacks</tt>. For example lets
assume that the name of the new map pack should be <b>mymappack</b>.
Therefore you have to create the package <tt>mobac.mapsources.mappacks.mymappack</tt>.
Place all Java source files within this package (sub-packages are also
possible).</p>
<p>Additionally you have to create a text file named <tt>mapsources.list</tt>
inside the package <tt>mobac.mapsources.mappacks.mymappack</tt>. This
file contains a list of class names (full class name including the
package name, one per line) that should be loaded by MOBAC as map
source.</p>
<p>Background: During the build process this file will be included
into the map-pack jar as <tt>META-INF/services/mobac.program.interfaces.MapSource</tt>
so that it can be found by the <a
	href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">ServiceLoader</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="MapPackBuilding">Building the map pack</a></h3>
<p>Map packs can be built separately using <a
	href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> and the build target <b>build_mapsources</b>:</p>
<pre>ant build_mapsources</pre>
<p>Apache Ant is already included in Eclipse, so that you only have
to select the file <tt>build.xml</tt>, press the right mouse button and
select <b>Run As</b> - <b>Ant Build...</b>. In the dialogs that opens
deselect the build target <b>all</b> and select instead <b>build_mapsources</b>.</p>
<p>Each sub-package of <tt>mobac.mapsources.mappacks</tt> will be
compiled and packed to an map package. The created map packages are
saved into the <tt>mapsources</tt> directory. Therefore our example map
pack will be packed into the file <tt>mapsources/mp-mymappack.jar</tt></p>


<h2><a name="ImportantPackages">Source code overview - important packages</a></h2>
<h3><a href="src/main/java/mobac/gui">mobac.gui</a></h3>
<p>This package contains the implementation of all dialogs/windows.
In the sub-packages you can find the related implementations of used
graphical components - e.g. <tt><a
	href="src/main/java/mobac/gui/mapview/PreviewMap.java">mobac.gui.mapview.PreviewMap</a></tt>
- the component that draws the movable map background used by Mobile
Atlas Creator.</p>
<h3><a href="src/main/java/mobac/mapsources">mobac.mapsources</a></h3>
<p>Holds the infrastructure and the implementation of all map
sources available within Mobile Atlas Creator. For implementing own map
sources that uses an online map you should derive your map source from
the abstract base class <a
	href="src/main/java/mobac/mapsources/AbstractHttpMapSource.java"><tt>mobac.mapsources.AbstractHttpMapSource</tt></a>.
Map sources should be compiled and packed to a map pack so that they can
be automatically detected and loaded while MOBAC is starting-up. For
details on that topic please read section <a href="#CustomMapPack">Developing
a custom map pack</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="src/main/java/mobac/program/atlascreators">mobac.program.atlascreators</a></h3>
<p>Holds the implementations of all atlas creators (atlas output
formats) provided by Mobile Atlas Creator. Each class in the package
implements exactly one atlas output format. Of special interest is the
abstract class <a
	href="src/main/java/mobac/program/atlascreators/AtlasCreator.java">AtlasCreator</a>
which is the super class every atlas creator is derived of. The list of
available formats is maintained in the enumeration <a
	href="src/main/java/mobac/program/model/AtlasOutputFormat.java"><tt>mobac.program.model.AtlasOutputFormat</tt></a>.
</p>

<h3><a href="src/main/java/mobac/tools">mobac.tools</a></h3>
<p>This package contains additional stand-alone tools that are not
shipped with the Mobile Atlas Creator binary release. For example the <a
	href="src/main/java/mobac/tools/MapSourcesTester.java"><tt>mobac.tools.MapSourcesTester</tt></a>
downloads one tile from each map source for verifying that the map
source is functional.</p>
